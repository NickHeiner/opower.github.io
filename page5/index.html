      <p>Dave, My OPOWER colleague switched from a normal office desk &amp; chair situation to a standing desk more than a year ago and ever since, I’d been considering doing the same.  For my entire programming career, I’ve had terrible posture in my chair and tended to do “the maxell pose” where my wrists are resting at a severe angle on the lip of my desk.</p>

<p><img src="/img/maxell_blown_away.jpg" alt="The Maxwell Pose" /></p>

<p>There have been a couple articles recently about the effects of sitting in a chair all day that pushed me to action.  This <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/10_19/b4177071221162.htm">article from business week</a> was particularly eye opening.</p>

<p>OPOWER is super cool about empowering developers to be more productive/comfortable/happy/etc so getting approval for expensing some generic Ikea furniture was as easy as a head nod.  A couple weekends ago, I drove down to Ikea and picked up an <a href="http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/S49843462">Utby desk</a> for about $100 and an <a href="http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/90167477">Ekby Viktor</a> shelf with <a href="http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/00054564">Capita</a> legs for another $20 or so.  I didn’t think the desk by itself was going to be quite at the recommended elbow height, so I swung by Home Depot and got 4 cinder blocks too.</p>

<p>I ended up putting a stack of paper between my monitor and the shelf to really get it up at eye level and I’m pretty happy with the way it turned out:</p>

<p><img src="/img/standing_desk_tom.jpg" alt="Me enjoying my new standing desk." /></p>

<p>Dave’s setup is very similar, but he seems to like focusing <em>down</em> on his single screen whereas I like having a couple monitors at different focus points where I can physically distinguish tasks (documentation, music, images on my laptop off to the side and development tasks on the main monitor straight ahead).</p>

<p><img src="/img/standing_desk_dave-225x300.jpg" alt="Dave at his standing desk" /></p>

<p>It’s been a couple weeks since I switched and I can draw the following conclusions so far:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Your feet hurt like a sonofabitch at the end of 8, 9, 10 hours if you’re not used to standing that whole time</li>
  <li>A little bar stool or some off-the-floor step helps a lot in shifting your weight around so you’re not always bearing down on both heels</li>
  <li>My back feels a ton better</li>
  <li>I <em>feel</em> more productive (though I don’t know empirically if I actually am) because (a) I feel really focused on the monitor right in front of me – more so than when sitting down and (b) I’m a little more self-conscious of my screen being visible to everyone walking by, so I suspect I’ve got a higher percentage of work-related stuff on my screen at all times than I did before.</li>
</ul>

      <p>If you’ve ever seen Yoni or Jeff K, you would know that I have absolutely no chance of competing in a facial-hair competition with them on raw natural talent.  Thus, for the 2010 Cinco de Mustache event, I felt compelled to compete on ingenuity and engineering.</p>

<p>To the disgust of myself and my wife, I collected shavings for approximately 4 months in a plastic cream cheese jar labeled “Not Cream Cheese.”</p>

<p>This last weekend, I took a trip to AC Moore Arts &amp; Crafts and bought some clay.  I fashioned a mold into that clay of a mustache that would dominate all other mustaches.</p>

<p>Into that mold, I poured elmer’s glue, hair shavings, 14 gauge electrical copper wiring, more hair, more glue, more hair.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tom_vaughan/4581864452/"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4035/4581864452_ba14d1b7ab.jpg" alt="cinco_assembly" /></a></p>

<p>This morning, the <em>plan</em> was to simply glue the assembled mustache on to my real mustache.  Unfortunately, the plan involved entirely too much super glue and the assembled mustache pieces proved to be entirely too heavy.  My previous experience with krazy-glue-on-skin is probably like most people’s… stick your thumb and index finger together.  Thanks to callouses, a lack of hair on your fingertips and the relative strength of your digits, it’s not that big of a deal.  I also don’t remember the glue <em>burning like lava on contact.</em></p>

<p>A split second before squirting a liberal does of krazy glue on the mustache I wondered: “is this really a good idea?”  But not wanting to pysch myself out, I quickly brought the assembled mustache up to my lip and pressed down hard.</p>

<p>The first thing I remember thinking is that this was going to look <em>really</em> good.  Like, maybe champion-quality entry.</p>

<p>That thought was quickly replaced with a rising alarm about the rapidly increasing burning sensation I was experiencing between the mustache and my lip.  That alarm was then replaced with the growing realization that I was inhaling quite a bit of vapor and that my throat was starting to burn.</p>

<p>Not-quite-panicked, but not totally calm either, I gently tried to remove the mustache and got as far as pulling my lip about an inch off my face before giving up.  Over the next 10 minutes I was able to saw, snip and shave the ‘stache down with a combination of electric shaver, electrical pliers, scissors and razor blade.  By that time, of course, the fumes had dissipated and the burning was just a low heat and my grand mustache plans were wrecked.</p>

<p><em>The redness of my eyes is due to the fumes and pain.</em></p>

<p>There’s always 2011…</p>

      <h2><a href="/2010/04/30/alfresco-3-3-lunch-learn">Alfresco 3.3 Lunch & Learn</a></h2>
      <p class="meta pull-right">Written on April 30, 2010 by tom.vaughan</p>
      <div class="clearfix"></div>
      <div class="post-content">
      <p>I attended the Reston, VA “Alfresco 3.3 lunch &amp; learn” seminar this week, hosted by the generous folks over at <a href="http://www.siteworx.com/">SiteWorx</a>.  I have a couple years as “CMS guru” at some previous jobs so in addition to being interested in the field, I’m also the support guy in-house for our CMS needs.</p>

<p>We here at OPOWER use Alfresco Community 3.2 as a glorified “XML editing tool” that was easy to setup, configure and hand over to the business to allow them to contribute XML-based content that our applications can consume.  As a F/LOSS solution, it’s fit our needs pretty well and is generally a low-maintenance piece of our infrastructure.</p>

<p>I attribute my “low maintenance” characterization of an Alfresco installation mostly to the patience of my small user base, who are very accommodating to the quirks and limitations of the installed (and neglected) instance.</p>

<p>The 3.3 lunch and learn was intro’d by Chris from SiteWorx who surveyed the CMS landscape and equated the emerging CMIS spec as “content’s ODBC” which I thought to be a quite fitting analogy.</p>

<p>Richard Im from Alfresco then spoke for about 45 minutes about the new features Alfresco 3.3 contained:</p>

<h3 id="wcm-improvements">WCM Improvements</h3>

<ul>
  <li>new web-based editor, reminiscent of Interwoven’s in-context editor from the 6.5/7.0 era</li>
  <li>new bi-directional deployment capabilities (including addition of “delivery server” infrastructure possibilities like several other CMS offerings)</li>
  <li>“Straight through” publishing without workflows</li>
  <li>google-like search on metadata attributes</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="share">Share</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Evolving share into more of a bit-for-bit replacement of the “traditional” UI (which Richard referred to as “DM”… “document manager?”)</li>
  <li>Permission control a la DM</li>
  <li>Rules and Actions just like in DM</li>
  <li>Data Lists (like Share Point’s project lists)</li>
</ul>

<p>I asked the question: “what’s the medium-term road map for DM, if Alfresco seems intent on mirroring all(?) functionality in the traditional UI via the /share context?”  Richard wouldn’t definitively say that the traditional app is going to be deprecated any time soon, but it certainly appears that way…</p>

<h3 id="integration-improvements">“Integration” improvements</h3>

<p>I think this suite of improvements is geared towards the enterprise crowd:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Full CMIS 1.0 spec implemented as of 3.3 (the only open source implementation known to do so)</li>
  <li>ACLs</li>
  <li>Change Logs</li>
  <li>Additional SOA/REST services and support</li>
  <li>Ability to save off google docs in alfresco for management (!)</li>
</ul>

<p>My big take-aways from the lunch and Q&amp;A session was that Alfresco’s 3.3 feature list and 3.4 direction seem to put them on more of a competitive footing with monster ECM vendors like Interwoven.  It’s maybe an odd direction for an open source project to steer because while Alfresco certainly employs their own development team, I’m not sure how much community interest there is in contributing to some of the more mundane enterprise ECM concerns that need to be built or integrated.  On the other hand, Alfresco, Inc. does survive with enterprise support contracts that smaller shops like mine are unlikely to ever pay top-dollar for, so maybe it’s a long term survival strategy.</p>

<p>Long term, I’m interested in exploring architectures available to us with a SOA-enabled CMIS layer and eventually ditch the custom-DAO layer we’re running right now against Alfresco-exported XML flat files.  Even if that never happens, it’s exciting to see the kinds of complexity that open source projects are able to attack.</p>

      <p>The developers have an informal “Tie Tuesday” each work.  It’s exactly what it sounds like.  And, since you asked, yes, it is more fun to wear a tie when you don’t have to.  Not everyone does it every week, but this week, we had the best participation yet:</p>

      <p>The <a href="http://www.meetup.com/D-CAST/">DC Agile Software Testing MeetUp group</a> met for the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/D-CAST/events/16781293/">first time</a> yesterday. Thanks to everyone that attended for contributing to a very positive experience.</p>

<p>We’re looking for “Better Ways To Make Better Software”.</p>

<p>Agile software development is a great way to make good software that satisfies real needs and creates real value to those who build and use that software. Everyone on the team is concerned with the quality of the product. However, sometimes it can be an overwhelming task being the team member whose job it is to insure that the quality of the product is sufficient.</p>

<p>DCAST was created to develop a community of those interested in agile software testing who are also interested in testing agile products more effectively and more efficiently. By sharing our hard won knowledge we can all help make each other’s lives easier and more productive.</p>

<p>If you’re interested in sharing how you have raised the quality bar of your agile processes, we would love it if you were a part of this community. If you’re interested in learning (or want to all learn together), you’re even more welcome.</p>

<p>We’re going to be <a href="http://www.meetup.com/D-CAST/events/17021962/">meeting again in about a month</a>. Come check out the group if you’re in the DC area.</p>

      <p>The Discovery Channel spends an entire week every year convincing us how incredibly awesome sharks are.  How do they do it?  Do they take a mako shark out of the ocean, squeeze it into a suit, and ask it questions about being a shark?  Not hardly.  They let us watch the thing cruising through the open ocean, chasing tuna and scaring the hell out of everyone.</p>

<p>When you apply to OPOWER, we want to see how awesome YOU are in your natural habitat.  Our homework helps us do that – by giving you a project that you can complete on your own schedule, in your own environment.  Maybe you’re a “early-morning coffee and Eclipse” person, or an “up-all-night with pizza and vim” type.  Whatever it is, we want to see THAT.</p>

<p>Yes, we also have a more conventional part of our interview process.  You’ll talk to us on the phone and in person.  We’ll ask you about your current projects, make you answer some tough technical questions, and write code together on a whiteboard.  But the homework is our way of asking you to show us what you’re like, on your own terms.</p>

<p>We take our homework pretty seriously, and hope you do, too.  Think carefully about the problems.  Explain what you did (and what you didn’t do) using comments and READMEs.  And give us your best code – polish counts more than features.  Code that’s lean, appropriately commented, and thoroughly tested is going to earn high marks, guaranteed.</p>

<p>Our application process is hard.  We know, because every single person in OPOWER’s engineering group has been through it.  We do it this way because we want a team full of great people that can produce reliable, real-world solutions.  It may be more work for everybody up front, but we think it’s produced great results.  And we think you’ll agree when you join us.</p>

      <p>It’s been several months, but we are still <a href="http://www.opowerjobs.com">hiring like crazy</a>, with no chance of stopping.  We get a ton of résumés, and there are many internal hoops a candidate’s application package must jump through before we bring someone in for an interview.  Our goal is for anyone who’s brought in for an in-person interview to have a very high likelihood of being extended an offer.  To that end, everything is reviewed by OPOWER developers directly.  Résumés go through an initial screening with our recruiters, but everything else goes straight to us, and we look at everything closely and carefully.</p>

<p>One thing I’ve noticed about successful candidates is <em>polish</em>.  This isn’t a word thrown around when discussing developers a whole lot, but I’ve found it to be a strong indicator of a true software professional.  The OPOWER application is more than just a résumé; it’s a written quiz and a coding assignment as well. Sloppiness at any point is a negative; it shows that the candidate just doesn’t give a shit about getting the job.  It’s not a deal-breaker, but it has a huge effect on how excited we get about a candidate, <strong>and</strong> it could be the deciding factor between two otherwise identical candidates.  It’s our version of <a href="http://gettingreal.37signals.com/ch08_Wordsmiths.php">“hire the better writer.”</a></p>

<p>So, what do I mean by “polish”?  Here’s a few examples:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Make your code <em>better</em> than you would “at work.”  Don’t make me download the JUnit jar and type <code>javac `find . -name "*.java"`</code> to compile your code; give me a <code>pom.xml</code> or Ant file with Ivy support.</li>
  <li>Send PDFs instead of MS-Word; they are so much easier on the eyes (and processor).  This is dead simple on OS X, <a href="http://www.cutepdf.com/products/cutepdf/writer.asp">there’s some free options for Windows</a>, and there’s always <a href="http://www.latex-project.org/">LaTeX</a> (which will definitely earn you some geek cred :)</li>
  <li>Don’t send me the functional spec of your last project and call it a résumé.  Use bullet lists, short sentences, and formatting to create an easy-to-scan CV.</li>
  <li>Format your writing; compare <a href="/img/sloppy.jpg">this</a>, to <a href="/img/polished.jpg">this</a>.  Even though they both are excerpts from correctly-answered quizzes, which one is going to be easier and more engaging for me to read?</li>
  <li>English: <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110912/quotes">do you speak it?</a>.  Being able to communicate effectively using the written word is absolutely <strong>crucial</strong> for being a good developer, especially at OPOWER.  It doesn’t need to be your first, or even best, language; you just need to wield it as effectively as you do Java</li>
</ul>

<p>A lack of polish won’t get you refused, but putting an extra shine on your application can make you stand out quite a bit.</p>

      <h2><a href="/2010/10/07/opower-engineering-principles">OPOWER Engineering Principles</a></h2>
      <p class="meta pull-right">Written on October 07, 2010 by jeff.kolesky</p>

      <div class="post-content">
      <p>We are engineers.  Not programmers, developers, or coders; and certainly not hackers.  The distinction is important, because we are building a system for the long haul, not just a class or script or even an application.  It is our responsibility to keep the entire operating environment in mind as we think about what we build, because we must consider all components of the system in order to build it to sustain the life of the business.  Hackers do not do this type of work.  Engineers do.  We are engineers.</p>

<p>As engineers our core principles include</p>

<ul>
  <li>Thinking</li>
  <li>Testing</li>
  <li>Improving</li>
  <li>Tooling</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="thinking">Thinking</h3>

<p>All projects need a certain amount of forethought put into them before code hits the screen.  In fact all need just the right amount.  As engineers, it is our responsibility to determine how much thought is needed and how to best communicate the output of that thought.  We rely on the maturity, discipline, and experience of our team to make the right decisions every day, balancing purity of design with what is most practical.  We should not expect to get a design wrong the first time, nor should we expect to get it right.  Rather we should expect to get it pointing in the right direction.  We do not create throw away designs that we expect to refactor later.  That is a flawed philosophy that allows people to design on the fly while coding.  We create designs that lay a a foundation for future functionality.  Our designs are informed by the past, focus on the present, and keep an eye on the future.</p>

<h3 id="testing">Testing</h3>

<p>Quality of our product is very important, because our products affect millions of people daily.  As such, testing is baked into our philosophy and methodology from the start.  We do not necessarily employ test-driven development, but we start writing test specs when we begin a story.  All team members are responsible for quality, and all are responsible for writing tests: unit, integration, and regression – whatever is appropriate for the feature.  When a bug is discovered, a test is written to reproduce the bug before code is changed to fix it.  This is the best way to ensure the bug does not creep back in later.  As much as possible, tests are fully automated and run with each continuous integration build.</p>

<h3 id="improving">Improving</h3>

<p>Continuous integration is old hat now.  People are talking about continuous deployment more and more.  We believe in continuous improvement and are on a constant mission to better our process, designs, code and knowledge.  For process, we run post-mortem reviews after each iteration, cataloging what worked well and what did not, resulting in suggestions of ways to change.  Since we are wedded only to what works, we can adapt until we find the right thing.  For designs and code, we run group reviews on a weekly basis, allowing for anyone to present a design or code sample for review by his peers.  These meetings are when we solidify our standards and conventions as well as informally teach good design thinking and share knowledge of the frameworks and tools we use to make our team more efficient.  Increasing individuals’ knowledge is a more self-directed activity; we rely on the team to investigate and research topics they are interested in and will support them through book purchases, course reimbursement and conference sponsorship.  To support our efforts at continuous improvement, we also follow a practice of continuous feedback.  In addition to formal performance evaluations, we collect short bits of feedback (“tweets” if you will) after each iteration to make sure all team members know where they are doing well and how they can improve.</p>

<h3 id="tooling">Tooling</h3>

<p>We choose the right tools for the job.  This is as much an imperative to consider legacy and the team’s skills as it is to push the boundaries with new tools at our disposal.  The important aspect of this tenet is that any tool must be the right tool, which means its appropriateness must be evaluated before it is used.  We do not start using the latest tool just because it is new – we use it because it solves a problem we have in a way better than any current tool without creating new bigger problems.  This is not an “if you have a hammer” kind of philosophy, but more along the lines of choosing the right size hammer for the job.</p>

                <h2>Moving Day</h2>
<p class="meta">30 Oct 2009</p>

<div class="post">
<p>We officially out-grew our Rosslyn space today and moved in to a new space right next to the Court House metro stop.</p>

<p><img src="/img/movingday_kitchen1-300x226.png" alt="movingday_kitchen"> We&#39;ve got a new kitchen area that&#39;s big enough to hold the company for a stand-up meeting...we haven&#39;t had that capability for what seems like forever.   There&#39;s a pantry off to the left of the image (not shown) stocked with drinks, chips, pens and pads.</p>

<p><img src="/img/movingday_lobby-300x235.png" alt="movingday_lobby">We&#39;ve got a nice lobby area too...through the windows in the background one can see the National Cathedral, Georgetown and most of Northwest DC. One of the things we&#39;re all looking forward to most about the new space is the number of break away areas and conference rooms.</p>

<p><img src="/img/movingday_sasquatch-225x300.png" alt="movingday_sasquatch">Our working space is, as you can see, very open.  In the old office, that was occasionally annoying because sound echoed off the relatively confined space and amplified the drone of office sounds.  This space is well carpeted and more &quot;open&quot; so it seems quite a bit quieter.
The guy in the middle of this picture actually does the &quot;Messin&#39; with Sasquatch&quot; series of commercials for Jack Links Beef Jerkey.  He got the part because he needed less time in costume than the other actors.</p>

<p>The new location means a whole new suite of lunch places to try out.  That&#39;s a relief because the Chop&#39;t -&gt; Chipotle -&gt; Chop&#39;t cycle was wearing pretty thin back in Rosslyn.</p>

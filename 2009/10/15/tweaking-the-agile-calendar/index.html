                <h2>Tweaking the Agile Calendar</h2>
<p class="meta">15 Oct 2009</p>

<div class="post">
<p>For the first five iterations, the dev team had been following this schedule:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Iteration N, Week 1 = Design for iteration N and 2nd week of QA for iteration N-1</p></li>
<li><p>Iteration N, Week 2 = Development</p></li>
<li><p>Iteration N, Week 3 = Development</p></li>
<li><p>Iteration N, Week 4 = 1st week of QA for iteration N</p></li>
<li><p>Iteration N, Week 5 / Iteration N +1, Week 1 = 2nd week of QA for iteration N, design for iteration N + 1</p></li>
</ul>

<p>We started to notice a couple things that have caused us to try out a new schedule in our upcoming 6th iteration.</p>

<p>First, we realized that we left very little time for fit to hit the shan.  If we had a tough QA cycle, we didn&#39;t design enough.  If we didn&#39;t design enough, we underestimated how much development would be needed (i.e. too many story points).  If we had too many story points, we&#39;d go in to QA late.  And the cycle repeats.</p>

<p>Note that many of you Agile purists out there will cringe at the above description, especially this sentence: &quot;If we had too many story points, we&#39;d go in to QA late.&quot;</p>

<p>I know.  We cringed too.</p>

<p>We&#39;re committing to a couple new explicit practices going in to our next iterations:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>More formal velocity check-ins.  If less than 50% of our story points are closed by COB of the first Friday, we should have a come-to-jeebus meeting on Monday morning.</p></li>
<li><p>We absolutely need to respect the impact that dedicated design time has on the effectiveness of everything down-stream.  It&#39;s too easy to say &quot;Agile&quot; as a synonym for &quot;code by the seat of your pants,&quot; but that&#39;s not what it&#39;s about and we know that.  We just need to get better at dedicating time to it.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>So with those ideas in mind, we&#39;re moving to something like the following:</p>

<p><img src="/img/iteration_detail_screenprint_cropped.png" alt="iteration_detail_screenprint_cropped"></p>

<p>It&#39;s a five-week iteration, with 2 solid weeks built in for QA and 1 dedicated week of design.</p>

<p>I think if we can get to a point where our regression and automation testing is good enough (and we develop enough confidence our automated tests), that we may be able to get back to a 4 week cycle.  In the mean time, we&#39;re going to see if we can actually go faster by slowing down.</p>

<p>Stay tuned!</p>

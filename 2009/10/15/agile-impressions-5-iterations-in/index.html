                <h2>Agile impressions, 5 iterations in...</h2>
<p class="meta">15 Oct 2009</p>

<div class="post">
<p>I&#39;m assuming from the amount of hype out there that if a development team isn&#39;t using &quot;Agile&quot; right now, they probably feel like the one kid on the block who didn&#39;t have a Nintendo (with the Duck Hunt option, of course).</p>

<p><img src="/img/duckhunt-300x165.png" alt="duckhunt">Well, we here at OPOWER loved our Duck Hunt, so we&#39;ve been attempting to use &quot;Agile&quot; for the last 5 months or so.  Agile means a lot of things to a lot of people, so I&#39;ll spell out what it means for us and then reflect on some of the pros, cons, and room-for-improvement in our practice.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><cringe>Embrace change</cringe> (duh)...but especially in this startup environment, we need to remember to do no more than is necessary, because any &quot;extra mile&quot; functionality is likely to be totally unused as priorities and direction changes.</p></li>
<li><p>Be scientific about development...<a href="/2009/08/19/measuring-our-awesomeness-iteration-by-iteration">measure, measure measure</a>.  We track velocities, average-open-days-per-bug-by-severity, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>&quot;Individuals and interactions over processes and tools&quot;...we self-organize, aren&#39;t afraid to try new combinations of responsibilities and assignments, provide regular feedback to each other and we don&#39;t dictate a development environment or technology stack.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The best thing about the technical side of this company is that the entire development team and project management team is on-board with the idea of rapid iterations, continuous improvement and a focus on technical excellent and &quot;maximizing the amount of work not done.&quot;</p>

<p>This manifests itself in several practices that I&#39;d chalk up in the &quot;pro&quot; column:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Light weight documentation...use wikis and person-to-person contact (recorded on bug tickets for posterity) to flush out designs and requirement.</p></li>
<li><p>Continuous integration and continuous improvement (we just installed Sonar last week...we&#39;ll blog about its effectiveness later)</p></li>
<li><p>Regular code reviews, 360 reviews, and &quot;how did we collectively perform this iteration&quot; meetings</p></li>
<li><p>Few formal meetings, many informal, impromptu &quot;drive bys&quot;</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>But the best thing about our Agile environment</strong> right now is that it is a work-in-progress &quot;process framework&quot; that repeats quickly enough for us to remember what to improve.</p>

<p>What do I mean by that?</p>

<p>It&#39;s my impression that on the longer, more drawn-out software engagements (say...6 or 12 months), you can make a series of mistakes in the design phase, the build phase, the qa phase, etc. and then by the time you&#39;re on the next project you repeat all those mistakes again because it&#39;s been 6 or 12 months since you last learned your lesson.  Instead of concrete lessons, you develop a career full of &quot;gut instincts.&quot;</p>

<p>We&#39;re still honing in on the right amount of measurement and process for OPOWER, but because we&#39;re all on board with the idea of quick-hit iterations with a continuous focus on improvement, I have high hopes for our ability to become (stay?) a top-notch software engineering organization.</p>

<p><img src="/img/duckhunt_many-300x213.png" alt="duckhunt_many">There&#39;s lots of room for improvement, that I think I&#39;ll save for another post on another day.  We could definitely stand to &quot;communicate out&quot; more-- with the product team and with our operations team.  We need to do a better job of making sure our iterations are lining up with the corporate strategy.  We could improve on the whole &quot;customer collaboration over contract negotiation&quot; part of the manifesto.  But you can only squeeze that trigger so fast, right?</p>

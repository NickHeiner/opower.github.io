                <h2>Locking screens on Macs with the keyboard</h2>
<p class="meta">24 Nov 2009</p>

<div class="post">
<p>Desktop security is a big issue when you have access to massive amounts of data.  As far as plain old terminal security, locking your computer while you&#39;re away is a pretty basic rule.</p>

<p>We have lots of OSes around the office here - Ubuntu, Windows, and OSX.  Of those, Ubuntu and Windows natively provide a way to lock your desktop with a keystroke (Win+L or Ctrl+Alt+Del, Enter on Windows and Ctrl+Alt+L on Ubuntu).  Strangely, Mac gives no easy way to lock your desktop.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve been using HotCorners for the screen saver, but who wants to touch the mouse if you don&#39;t have to (especially when you&#39;re racing to grab a free lunch)?</p>

<p>Enter <a href="http://www.macupdate.com/info.php/id/14831">Quicksilver</a>, everyone&#39;s favorite application interface.  (There are all sorts of things you can do with Quicksilver and its various plug-ins, but you can look that up yourself.) To set up a keyboard shortcut with Quicksilver to lock your screen (hat tip to <a href="http://www.brynary.com/2007/4/11/mac-tip-keyboard-shortcut-for-screen-saver">Bryan Helmkamp</a>):</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Create a symbolic link to your screen saver application:
<code>$ sudo ln -s /System/Library/Frameworks/ScreenSaver.framework/Versions/Current/Resources/ScreenSaverEngine.app/ /Applications/Screen\ Saver.app</code></p></li>
<li><p>Quicksilver -&gt; Triggers -&gt; Custom Triggers</p></li>
<li><p>Add a Hotkey</p></li>
<li><p>Find the ScreenSaverEngine by typing and press enter</p></li>
<li><p>Double-click the cell in the Trigger column</p></li>
<li><p>Choose your hotkey (I like Ctrl+Cmd+\ since it&#39;s almost Ctrl+Alt+Del</p></li>
<li><p>Close the window (you may also need to restart QS</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Now set up your System Prefs in Security -&gt; General to require a password immediately after screen saver begins and you&#39;re set.</p>

<p>Sadly, you need to do this or your screen saver will awake as soon as you release your QS shortcut.  This even happens if you set QS to launch screen saver &quot;On Release&quot;.</p>

<p>Anyway, after that, lock screen is just a keystroke away.
  *[Ctrl+Cmd+]: control command backslash
  *[OSes]: operating systems
  *[Ctrl+Alt+L]: control alt L
  *[Ctrl+Alt+Del]: control alt delete
  *[QS]: Quicksilver</p>

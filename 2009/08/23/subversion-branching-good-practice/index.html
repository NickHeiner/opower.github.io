<div class="post">
<p>I am relatively new to Subversion â€” well, two years into using it now, but this is the first project I have used it on.  Subversion, like any tool, has its quirks and works best when you really know how to use it.  When I started, I treated the &quot;trunk/branches/tags&quot; directory structure exactly like a directory structure.  It took me a little playing around until I stumbled on what I would call a best practice.  When I checkout a new project, I do it like so:</p>

<p><code>svn co http://domain.com/svnroot/project/trunk project</code></p>

<p>That way, when I go to the <code>project</code> directory, I do not have to then go into the <code>trunk</code> directory to get to my files.  Saving an extra directory level is not the best benefit though.  When I set up my IDE (yes, I use an IDE), I put the IDE files in that one directory and do not have to recreate them for each branch or tag that I might check out.  I essentially treat the &quot;trunk/branches/tags&quot; part of the directory as pure metadata, which makes perfect sense to me.</p>

<p>When I switched over to this system, there was one big drawback.  I could not easily tell where I am just by looking at my prompt.  I had to run <code>svn info | grep URL</code> to see if I was on a branch.  So instead of letting my prompt handicap me, I decided to get smart about my prompt.  Using bash, my prompt used to look like this:</p>

<p><code>jeff:/opt/pose/main/report/src/main/java</code></p>

<p>but now it looks like this (supercharged with Subversion metadata):</p>

<p><code>jeff:/opt/pose/main/report/src/main/java [SVN: /main/report/trunk]</code></p>

<p>I&#39;m no bash expert, so I dug around on the web and learned a bit about how <code>PROMPT_COMMAND</code> works.  Here is what I have in my <code>.bash_profile</code> now:</p>

<p><code>
function spwd () 
{ 
    stat .svn &gt; /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1;
    if [ &quot;$?&quot; == &quot;0&quot; ]; then
        SURL=</code>svn info | grep URL | perl -pe &#39;s/URL: (.<em>)/\1/&#39;<code>;
        if [</code>echo ${SURL} | grep -E &quot;branches|tags&quot;<code>]; then
            SVER=</code>echo ${SURL} | perl -pe &#39;s{.</em>/(branches|tags)/(.<em>)}{\1/\2}&#39; | cut -d/ -f1-2<code>;
            SPTH=</code>echo ${SURL} | perl -pe &#39;s{.</em>svnroot/(.<em>)/(branches|tags)/.</em>}{/\1}&#39;<code>;
            SPWD=&quot;${SPTH}/${SVER}&quot;;
        else
            SPWD=</code>echo ${SURL} | perl -pe &#39;s{.<em>svnroot/(.</em>)/trunk(.*)}{/\1/trunk}&#39;<code>;
        fi;
        export PS1=&quot;\u:\w [SVN: $SPWD]\n$ &quot;;
    else
        export PS1=&quot;\u:\w $ &quot;;
    fi
}
export PROMPT_COMMAND=spwd
</code></p>

<p>It may not be the most efficient way to do it, but it sure works well and lets me know in an instant what trunk, branch or tag I happen to be working on at that very moment.</p>

<p>We&#39;re still too small of a company to have more than 1 or 2 logical groupings of the development team, and before today they&#39;ve been basically &quot;the web team&quot; and &quot;everyone else.&quot;  Of course, there&#39;s a lot of cross-pollination and everything nowadays ultimately manifests itself somehow as &quot;&#39;web&quot;.</p>

<p>Still, the &quot;everyone else&quot; paint brush was wearing thin.  In addition to the &quot;web team&quot;, we had &quot;the scale team&quot; (a.k.a &quot;Ops R&amp;D&quot;) and &quot;the AMI team&quot; and &quot;the core team&quot; and &quot;the report team&quot;. . .but most of those were &quot;teams&quot; averaged size 1 and their membership varied from iteration-to-iteration.</p>

<p>Sick of referring to ourselves with a hand-wave and a &quot;you-know. . .the non-web-team,&quot; I plugged our names in to an acronym engine and we found the perfect name for ourselves:</p>

<p><strong><em>The Cheated Frogs of Vim</em></strong></p>

<p>While I put in my fair share of vi time in previous development gigs, I&#39;m a little too fond of modern debuggers to go whole-hog with Vim as my &quot;IDE.&quot;  Dave, on the other hand, is pretty hard-core with his Vim skills, so our new team name may have some sticking power.</p>

<p>Our wizard graphics guy even cooked up a logo for us:</p>

<p>NEW LAW FOR DEVELOPERS:</p>

<p><em>If you throw an exception about some connection being refused, you&#39;d better damn well put what connection you were attempting to make in the exception message.</em></p>

<p>What inspired this law?Â  Thanks for asking.</p>

<p>Check out this snippet in the middle of an 80 line stack dump:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">2009-08-25 17:23:42.373::WARN:  Nested in org.springframework.beans.factory.BeanCreationException: Error creating bean with name &#39;coreAutopatcher&#39; defined in class path resource [config/migrationContext.xml]: Invocation of init method failed; nested exception is com.tacitknowledge.util.migration.MigrationException: Error applying patches:

<p>&quot;A ResourcePool could not acquire a resource from its primary factory or source&quot;.  Awesome.  Sooo helpful.  /wristsemoragegrowl</p>

<p>Also, a WARN?  Seriously?  You&#39;re a connection pool.  Do you think not connecting to your underlying datasource warrants maybe something as stern as an ERROR?  Or, heaven forbid, a FATAL?</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure I could have turned up logging somewhere, but I noticed Spring&#39;s DelegatingDataSource bean standing out from among the stack lines and set a break point on its called method to figure out exactly which of my many connections was unable to be resolved:</p>

<p><img src="/img/what_am_i_connecting_to.png" alt="what_am_i_connecting_to"></p>

<p>There&#39;s the culprit!  localhost:5455.  You know, whoever the idiot is who runs that localhost server needs to get his act together.  I should call the guys from YouTube and have them do a Maury Povich-style video expose on why he can&#39;t keep any of his connections stable.</p>

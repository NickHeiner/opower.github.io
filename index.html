    <p>After all that&rsquo;s been written about the <a href="/2013/07/07/the-story-of-the-big-data-elders">ancient Big Data elders</a>
and their artful discoveries, it seems appropriate to now lift the curtain and
reveal the modern, specific, and, sometimes dirty, details.</p>

<p>Before we do, let&rsquo;s get something out in the open right now: working at 
<a href="http://opower.com">Opower</a> is pretty great. We get to make an impact on this
 world, using fancy and effective behavioral science while working with cool 
 and exciting tech. Awesome, right?</p>

<h3 id="a-brief-history-of-data-storage-at-opower">A brief history of data storage at Opower</h3>
<p>We have been using MySQL as our main database since day one.  It has been good 
to us, and we have figured out how to scale it well enough.  But as our 
business has grown, so have our data storage needs.  Each of our utility 
company clients gives us historical energy data for their customers, and we 
store it indefinitely.  For utility companies that have smart meters 
installed, we store energy reads that occur every 15 minutes, hour, or day.<br />
For a meter with 15 minute resolution, we store 3000 times as much data as a 
standard meter that is read once a month.</p>

<p>As more and more utility companies install smart meters, we ingest more and 
more of this higher resolution data, which comes in more frequently than 
standard monthly data.  Those last two characteristics hit on two of the 
&ldquo;<a href="http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/3Vs">three V’s</a>&rdquo; that define &ldquo;Big
Data&rdquo;: volume and velocity.  As we have collected the smart meter data over
the last several years, we have figured out innovative ways to use it, and we 
want to accelerate our learning using the data.  To achieve that, we needed a 
system better suited to processing large amounts of data, and that is where 
Hadoop and HBase fit in.</p>

<p>We have a business case that fits HBase perfectly, because we need to perform 
large batch calculations (running a disaggregation of A/C usage from your 
energy data, for instance), and we need to serve up the results of those 
calculations with low latency.  HBase gives us the perfect mix of those two 
access patterns, and we have spent the last year working on our new storage 
system to do exactly this.</p>

<h3 id="using-it-is-one-thing-showing-it-is-another">Using it is one thing, showing it is another</h3>
<p>All of this fancy Big Data is pretty amazing but it&rsquo;s also not very sexy to 
the untrained eye. After several low-level demos making use of the terminal, 
logs and job tracker UI, we decided it was time to try a little harder. Let&rsquo;s 
ponder: what can we show to illustrate the fact that we process and store all 
of this energy data without breaking a sweat? </p>

<h4 id="table-size">Table size</h4>
<p>Showing table size is an obvious one. People understand what a terabyte 
represents (at the very least, they know it&rsquo;s bigger than their inbox). </p>

<p>For the demo, we gathered the table size data while our big test was running. 
We built a simple command-line tool that polls hdfs for the size of each 
table&rsquo;s directory. It keeps track of the sizes and outputs a json time series 
when the tool shuts down. It&rsquo;s designed to run from a gateway node that can 
run the hadoop command and run <code>hadoop fs du</code> on hdfs.</p>

<p>Source: <a href="https://github.com/opower/giant-squash">giant-squash</a></p>

<h4 id="job-progress">Job progress</h4>
<p>Showing the tables growing is interesting but it doesn&rsquo;t show all the work 
that&rsquo;s done in Hadoop to get this data in HBase. Let&rsquo;s add the job progress 
and input/output sizes. </p>

<p>This is very similar to <a href="https://github.com/opower/giant-squash">giant-squash</a> 
except that it collects data from the job tracker on the jobs that are running 
on the cluster. It also collects the data in-memory and dumps a json time 
series of the input/output sizes as well as map/reduce progress on exit.  </p>

<h4 id="putting-it-together">Putting it together</h4>
<p>Now that we&rsquo;ve got the data collected and our test is complete, let&rsquo;s animate 
it in fast-motion.</p>

<p>Based on this nice d3.js <a href="http://bost.ocks.org/mike/nations/">Motion Chart</a> 
demo, we created our version to animate the time series data. It reads the two 
json dumps and merges this in one visualization. Granted, it violates some of 
the <a href="http://moz.com/blog/data-visualization-principles-lessons-from-tufte">principles of data information visualization</a>
but it does make for a cool presentation and it gets people interested enough to
ask questions about it.</p>

<h4 id="hollywood-production">Hollywood production</h4>
<p>Finally we wrapped it in with a nice summary of the digestible numbers and a 
nice soundtrack and voilà.</p>

<p>Where are the explosions I hear you say? Well, maybe next time. After all, 
this is going to production in just a few weeks.</p>

    <p>There was a time, not so long ago, when everything was dark. Everything was 
dark except for a few rapidly moving glyphs that none could really understand. 
None could understand except for a few elders who had spent months of studying.  </p>

<p><em>Terminals, tiny fonts, hadoop command lines and hbase scans.</em> </p>

<p>The elders were wise but, in their learnings, they forgot what it was like to 
<em>not</em> understand. They had forgotten what it was like before they finally 
developed the ability to decipher it. </p>

<p>So it was in much frustration that they tried to share with the villagers the
meanings of these cryptic glyphs. They waved their hands, talked slowly and in
exhaustive details about what they saw. But the villagers weren&rsquo;t seeing. 
Nothing would do. They would stare in the darkness, not seeing the glyphs,
not  interested. They would then stand up and walk away not knowing what they had been looking at.</p>

<p><em>It&rsquo;s just hard to show Big Data to the non-initiated in a compelling way.</em></p>

<p>The elders, sitting on their stools, wondered how they could get the villagers 
interested. How could they ignite the fire of curiosity so that they too would 
want to learn about these great things?</p>

<p><em>This might have happened on <a href="http://campfirenow.com/">campfire</a></em>.</p>

<p>One elder who had a funny accent was listening but didn&rsquo;t say a word.</p>

<p><em>That&rsquo;s me, I&rsquo;m a <strong>Québécois</strong></em>.    </p>

<p>The next morning, when everyone was busy working, he said</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&ldquo;Dear friends, I have listened to you and I have a plan.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>&ldquo;I will make them interested if you give me your full trust and support.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>A 4 story point JIRA ticket.</em></p>

<p>The others elders looked at him, puzzled. </p>

<p>They all offered their trust and the strange one told them what his plan was:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&ldquo;I will first build the tools that will record all of what is happening.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Such as a java command-line tool that polls the jobtracker for job progress</em>
<em>as well as counters + another one that polls and records the table sizes.</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&ldquo;I will then summon the gods to make it rain the heaviest rain while the 
tools record the history.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>A full test workflow executed via our runner runs while the tools record data</em>
<em>about it.</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&ldquo;When the rain stops, I will gather the fruits from the tools and I will 
arrange a grandiose spectacle.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>A d3 visual animation of the jobs running overlaid with bars showing the</em>
<em>tables growing as the map/reduce jobs progress.</em></p>

<p>Finally, he added</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&ldquo;The villagers will gather on the afternoon of the last Tuesday of the 6th 
month to attend a showing of this majestic production.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>A video montage adding some jest to the whole extravaganza.</em> </p>

<p>The elders cheered, albeit slightly skeptical at first. </p>

<p>After 7 days of uninterrupted work, it was ready. The elders and the villagers 
gathered around the stage where everything was ready for all eyes to see. The 
strange one was absent but the elders proceeded, both anxious and excited. </p>

<p><em>Demo day was on June 25th but I was on vacation so the team had to present</em>
<em>the video.</em> </p>

<p>When the beautiful bright sight started before their eyes, the villages stood 
silent. The elders watched as everyone was all ears, eyes wide open seemingly
seeing for the first time what this was all about. They did not understand it 
immediately. They couldn&rsquo;t have. But when this was done, they asked to watch 
it again. They reached to the elders to learn more about what it was that they 
had seen. Some stayed and got interested enough to learn some of the glyphs. 
The villagers talked for a while and came back to the elders with a reward. </p>

<p><em>People were genuinely entertained, some people asked questions and some might</em>
<em>now think that this thing they weren&rsquo;t sure what it was about looks pretty</em>
<em>interesting.</em>  </p>

<p>And so, it started…</p>

    <h2><a href="/2013/03/29/timeshifting-in-hbase">Timeshifting in HBase</a></h2>
    <p class="meta pull-right">Written on March 29, 2013 by <a href="/authors/jeff-kolesky">Jeff Kolesky</a>
</p>
    <div class="clearfix"></div>
    <div class="post-content">
    <p>For our HBase table layout, we are following an entity-centric model,
evangelized to us by our friends at <a href="http://www.wibidata.com">WibiData</a>.  The idea is to put all of the
data about a single entity into a single row in HBase.  When you need to run
a computation that involves that entity&rsquo;s data, you have quick access to it by
the row key, and all of the data is stored close together on disk.
Additionally, against many <a href="http://www.ngdata.com/site/blog/62-ng.html">suggestions</a> from the HBase community,
and general confusion about <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-2406">how timestamps work</a>, we are using
timestamps with logical values.  Instead of just letting the region server
assign a timestamp version to each cell, we are explicitly setting those values
so that we can use timestamp as a true queryable dimension in our <code>get</code>s and
<code>scan</code>s.  In addition to the real timeseries data that is indexed using the cell
timestamp, we also have other columns that store metadata about the entity.
That data does not need to be logically timestamped, and we always just want the
most recent version of it.  Given this description, rows in the table look
something like this:</p>

<pre><code>timestamp    data     metadata
   2013      1.09
   2012      0.87
   2011      0.93     "house"
   2010      1.02
   2009      0.98
</code></pre>

<p>This shows a row that has five timeseries values in it and a piece of metadata
that we keep, a label describing where the data came from.  The metadata is
stored at the timestamp when we wrote it into the table, which in this example
is in 2011.  Since we imported historical data, and we use logical timestamps
for the data column, we have data going back to 2009.  One typical access
pattern is to query for all data from the beginning of &ldquo;last year&rdquo; up to now,
because we need that much data for many analyses.  If we ran a <code>get</code> for this
data, it would normally be set up like this (in pseudo-code, of course):</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="java"><span class="n">Get</span> <span class="n">get</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">Get</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">rowkey</span><span class="o">);</span>
<span class="n">get</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">addColumn</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">&quot;data&quot;</span><span class="o">);</span>
<span class="n">get</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">addColumn</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">&quot;metadata&quot;</span><span class="o">);</span>
<span class="n">get</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">setTimeRange</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="mi">2012</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="mi">2013</span><span class="o">);</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Unfortunately that <code>get</code> would not return us any data for the metadata column,
because there is no valid cell in that timerange.  We have two options: make
a second <code>get</code> for the metadata or figure out some other solution.  That second
solution is timeshifting.</p>

<p>Instead of storing the metadata column with a true server timestamp of when it
was written, we shift the timestamp by 50,000 years which makes the row data now
look like this:</p>

<pre><code>timestamp    data     metadata
  52011               "house"
   2013      1.09
   2012      0.87
   2011      0.93
   2010      1.02
   2009      0.98
</code></pre>

<p>Since we imported the data in 2011 and timeshifted the metadata column
timestamp, its new timestamp is 52,011.  We now change our <code>get</code> slightly by
setting an ending timestamp to be the logical &ldquo;end of time&rdquo;:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="java"><span class="n">Get</span> <span class="n">get</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">Get</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">rowkey</span><span class="o">);</span>
<span class="n">get</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">addColumn</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">&quot;data&quot;</span><span class="o">);</span>
<span class="n">get</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">addColumn</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">&quot;metadata&quot;</span><span class="o">);</span>
<span class="n">get</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">setTimeRange</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="mi">2012</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">Long</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">MAX_LONG</span><span class="o">);</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Now, we will get data for the data column and for the metadata column
using only one RPC.  The benefit of HBase being a sparse datastore is that the
data for the metadata column is stored on disk right next to the data for the
data column even though they are logically separated by 50,000 years.
There is no added overhead to the storage to account for this, and thus no added
processing when fetching it.  Furthermore, fetching data for just the metadata column still works
with <code>Result#getColumnLatest()</code>.</p>

<p>Yes, there is a problem for the future us of the year 52,011, but I&rsquo;m betting we
will all be using relational databases again by that point.</p>

    <p class="meta pull-right">Written on September 06, 2012 by <a href="/authors/tom-vaughan">Tom Vaughan</a>
</p>
    <div class="clearfix"></div>
    <div class="post-content">
    <p>I recently had the pleasure of upgrading our Java code base from a Spring-3.0.6 base to the latest Spring-3.1.2 libraries.  There were a couple unexpected hiccups I encountered that didn&rsquo;t have a ton of solutions on stackoverflow or the google, so I thought I&rsquo;d capture some of them here.</p>

<p>Additionally, it&rsquo;s pretty useful to <a href="http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/3.0.6.RELEASE_to_3.1.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT/changes.html">look over the method deprecation and removal page</a> that the spring guys published for just this kind of operation.</p>

<h3 id="changes-to-theorgspringframeworkjdbccoresimple-package">Changes to the org.springframework.jdbc.core.simple package</h3>

<p>The &lsquo;.simple&rsquo; package is deprecated (including the <code>SimpleJdbcTemplate</code> class) and there are two new classes you need to know about as you make the transition:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The <code>org.springframework.jdbc.JdbcTemplate</code> class is a drop-in replacement for the old <code>SimpleJdbcTemplate</code> class, <em>unless you&rsquo;re using named parameters in your queries.</em></li>
  <li>If you run SQL queries with named parameters through the <code>JdbcTemplate</code> your code will compile fine but you&rsquo;ll get odd <code>Serialization</code> exceptions or <code>ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsExceptions</code>.  For named parameter queries, you&rsquo;ll need to use the <code>org.springframework.jdbc.namedparam.NamedParameterJdbcTemplate</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Luckily, the <code>NamedParameterJdbcTemplate</code> wraps the new <code>JdbcTemplate</code> (well, actually the new <code>JdbcOperations</code>) so if you&rsquo;re like Opower and you&rsquo;ve got a top level <code>AbstractJdbcDAO</code> class that your JdbcDAOs extend from, you can just swap your Abstract class to extend the <code>NamedParameterJdbcTemplate</code> and you&rsquo;ll be off to a good start.</p>

<h3 id="supporting-named-parameter-queries-in-spring-312">Supporting named parameter queries in Spring-3.1.2</h3>

<p>One thing to be aware of is a swap in the argument list to the <code>.query()</code> method on the <code>NamedParameterJdbcTemplate</code> that used to work with the <code>SimpleJdbcTemplate</code>.  Note this signature difference between the <code>JdbcTemplate</code> and <code>NamedParameter</code> version isn&rsquo;t &ldquo;new&rdquo; between Spring 3.0 and 3.1, it&rsquo;s just that you used be able to get away with passing named parameters through the <code>SimpleJdbcTemplate</code> and now you can&rsquo;t.  As you&rsquo;re converting to the 3.1 spec, you&rsquo;ll need to correct for that laziness.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;ve got a SQL query containing named parameters and your code used to happily get by with this call to your <code>SimpleJdbcTemplate</code>&rsquo;s <code>.query</code> method:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="java"><span class="c1">// SQL query with named parameter ( the :zipCodes)</span>
<span class="n">String</span> <span class="n">sql</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;SELECT blah FROM foo WHERE zip_code IN (:zipCodes)&quot;</span>

<span class="c1">// Our row mapper</span>
<span class="n">RowMapper</span> <span class="n">rowMapper</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="o">...</span>

<span class="c1">// Our parameter Map for named parameter substitution</span>
<span class="n">ImmutableMap</span> <span class="n">paramMap</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">ImmutableMap</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">of</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">&quot;zipCodes&quot;</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">zipCodes</span><span class="o">);</span>

<span class="n">List</span> <span class="n">blah</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">getSimpleJdbcTemplate</span><span class="o">().</span><span class="na">query</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">sql</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">rowMapper</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">paramMap</span><span class="o">);</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>When using the <code>NamedParameterJdbcTemplate</code> in Spring-3.1.2 you&rsquo;ll need switch the argument order of your <code>rowMapper</code> and your <code>paramMap</code>, e.g:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="java"><span class="n">List</span> <span class="n">blah</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">getNamedParameterJdbcTemplate</span><span class="o">().</span><span class="na">query</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">sql</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">paramMap</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">rowMapper</span><span class="o">);</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>If you don&rsquo;t make the switch, your call to a <code>JdbcTemplate.query(sql, rowMapper, paramMap)</code> will happily compile because it meets the <code>JdbcTemplate</code>&rsquo;s method signature of</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="java"><span class="kd">public</span>  <span class="n">List</span> <span class="nf">query</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">String</span> <span class="n">sql</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">RowMapper</span> <span class="n">rowMapper</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">Object</span><span class="o">...</span> <span class="n">args</span><span class="o">)</span>
    <span class="kd">throws</span> <span class="n">DataAccessException</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>with the problem being that your <code>rowMapper</code> object gets passed in as the one and only varargs substitution variable to whatever &ldquo;?&rdquo; or &ldquo;:foo&rdquo; named parameter you may have in your query.  Depending on the query you&rsquo;re trying to run you&rsquo;ll get Serialization exceptions or something like this:</p>

<h3 id="spring-batch-2x-needs-spring-30s-deprecated-jdbcoperations">Spring-Batch 2.x needs Spring 3.0&rsquo;s deprecated JdbcOperations</h3>

<p>If you use Spring Batch&rsquo;s <code>org.springframework.batch.core.repository.dao.JdbcJobInstanceDao</code> you&rsquo;ll need to continue to support the deprecated spring-3.0.x <code>SimpleJdbcTemplate</code> because that&rsquo;s the only class allowed to be set on the <code>JdbcJobInstaceDAO</code> to help it query the DB to look up all the data out of your <code>BATCH_xxx</code> tables.  Track <a href="https://jira.springsource.org/browse/BATCH-1685">https://jira.springsource.org/browse/BATCH-1685</a> for details about when that deprecated requirement goes away.</p>

<h3 id="spring-securitys-accessdecisionvoter-became-parameterized">Spring Security&rsquo;s AccessDecisionVoter became parameterized</h3>

<p>We use Spring Security&rsquo;s <code>AccessDecisionVoter</code> to help us authorize (or not) SSO authenticated users.  We used to get away with this Spring-3.0 style implementation:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="java"><span class="kd">public</span> <span class="kd">class</span> <span class="nc">SSOVoter</span> <span class="kd">implements</span> <span class="n">AccessDecisionVoter</span> <span class="o">{</span>
<span class="o">...</span>
<span class="nd">@Override</span>
<span class="kd">public</span> <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="nf">vote</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">Authentication</span> <span class="n">authentication</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">Object</span> <span class="n">object</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">Collection</span> <span class="n">attributes</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">{</span>
    <span class="c1">// make a decision on authentication based on attributes</span>
<span class="o">...</span>
<span class="o">}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>With the parameterization of the <code>AccessDecisionVoter</code>, the new implementation looks like:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="java"><span class="kd">public</span> <span class="kd">class</span> <span class="nc">SSOVoter</span> <span class="kd">implements</span> <span class="n">AccessDecisionVoter</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">Object</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="o">{</span>
<span class="o">...</span>
<span class="nd">@Override</span>

<span class="o">}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<h3 id="new-abstract-method-onorgspringframeworkhttpclientclienthttpresponse">New abstract method on org.springframework.http.client.ClientHttpResponse</h3>

<p>If you use or mock Spring&rsquo;s <code>ClientHttpResponse</code> object, there&rsquo;s a new <code>public int getRawStatusCode() throws IOException</code> signature you&rsquo;ve got to implement.  With access to an <code>HttpStatus</code> object, that&rsquo;s pretty straightforward:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="java"><span class="nd">@Override</span>
<span class="kd">public</span> <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="nf">getRawStatusCode</span><span class="o">()</span> <span class="kd">throws</span> <span class="n">IOException</span> <span class="o">{</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="k">this</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">httpStatus</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">value</span><span class="o">();</span>
<span class="o">}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<h3 id="pay-attention-to-your-spring-context-xsd-versions">Pay attention to your spring context XSD versions</h3>

<p>At Opower, we explicitly spell out what XSD versions we pull in to our spring contexts (instead of just leaving the version off which defaults to the latest published version).  This makes upgrades like this more tedious, and in one case caused some digging to figure out that the spring tag library we were using for spring-security wasn&rsquo;t compatible with a transitive spring-security dependency being pulled in from spring-security-oauth.  If you get errors like &ldquo;spring security tag 3.0 library incompatible with class &hellip; blah&rdquo; make sure:</p>

<ol>
  <li>your spring context&rsquo;s XSD is pointing to <code>http://www.springframework.org/schema/security/spring-security-3.1.xsd</code></li>
  <li>your mvn dependency:tree is pulling in spring-security-3.1</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="spring-31-securitys-taglib-has-a-package-change">Spring 3.1 Security&rsquo;s Taglib has a package change.</h3>

<p>On first load of one of WARs, our login page greeted me with a fat stack trace starting at &ldquo;TemplateModelException: Could not load taglib information&rdquo; and ending at &ldquo;Caused by: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: org.springframework.security.taglibs.authz.AuthorizeTag&rdquo;.  The AuthorizeTag class has been renamed to &ldquo;JspAuthorizeTag&rdquo;, but there are a few minor formatting and documentation differences between the old and new (3.1) taglibs, so I just copied the whole security.tld taglib over top of the one I had in our WEB-INF from spring&rsquo;s fisheye site (google search for &ldquo;spring security.tld 3.1&rdquo;).</p>

<h3 id="spring-31-may-mean-an-update-to-your-oauth-dependency">Spring 3.1 may mean an update to your OAuth dependency</h3>

<p>Several of Opower&rsquo;s web apps leverage OAuth for aspects of our security.  When upgrading to spring-security 3.1, some problems will crop up if you&rsquo;re using ant-style filter chain maps in your <code>FilterChainProxy</code>.  For example, one of our <code>securityContext.xml</code> files contained this snippet:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="xml">xsi:schemaLocation=&quot;http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans-3.1.xsd
http://www.springframework.org/schema/security
http://www.springframework.org/schema/security/spring-security-3.1.xsd
http://www.springframework.org/schema/security/oauth
http://www.springframework.org/schema/security/spring-security-oauth.xsd&quot;
default-autowire=&quot;byName&quot;&gt;
...snip...
  <span class="nt">&lt;bean</span> <span class="na">id=</span><span class="s">&quot;filterChainProxy&quot;</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">&quot;org.springframework.security.web.FilterChainProxy&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;sec:filter-chain-map</span> <span class="na">path-type=</span><span class="s">&quot;ant&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
...snip...
</code></pre></div>

<p>When spinning up that context, I&rsquo;d get an error: &ldquo;java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: org.springframework.security.web.util.AntUrlPathMatcher.&rdquo;  Sure enough, there was no <code>AntUrlPathMatcher</code> in my spring-security-web-3.1.2 JAR on the classpath.  Fixing this necessitated an upgrade of our spring-security-oauth JAR from 1.0.0.M2 to 1.0.0.M6</p>

<p>Upgrading to the 1.0.0.M6 version of the spring-security-oauth JAR caused some of its own problems which ended up just being another package change (the <code>ProtectedResourceProcessingFilter</code> class ended up moving from <code>org.springframework.security.oauth.provider</code> to <code>org.springframework.security.oauth.provider.filter</code>).</p>

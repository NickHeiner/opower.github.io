    <p class="meta pull-right">Written on May 02, 2011 by <a href="/authors/jeff-kolesky">Jeff Kolesky</a>

    <p>OPOWER has a set of company values, the first of which is &ldquo;We are double bottom line.&rdquo;  Our two bottom lines are the environment (we want to improve that) and money (we want to make that).  Everyone in the company is fully bought in to the first bottom line.  Given our enterprisey business model, the engineering team cannot contribute directly to the company making money (accounting lingo deems us a liability, as does HR sometimes), so we have a slightly different second bottom line.</p>

<p>We focus on how we build the product to ensure it supports the business for the long haul.  We take this part of our job very seriously and are constantly working to improve how we work.  We use some of the obvious practices from agile like scrum teams, story pointing, and short-term iteration planning to keep ourselves on track with the functionality we need to build over a three iteration horizon.  A more out-of-the-ordinary practice is having test team members fully embedded on our scrum teams.  The software engineers in test work alongside software engineers building functionality, and a task is not considered finished until it is tested through our automated regression suite.</p>

<p>We do team retrospectives almost every iteration and keep a backlog of tasks to work on during regression weeks to keep improving our tools and process.  When it comes to coding, we have formal code reviews every three weeks as part of the iteration cycle, and ad hoc code reviews happen during the build.  Some of our reviews can get heated (though not personal), and everyone knows that the intent is to build the best product we can.  The reviews are also a lot of fun.</p>

<p>The point of all of this work is to get everyone in line with building a product for the future.  OPOWER is only four years old, and our product has been live and generating energy efficiency gains for over three years.  We are pushing ourselves to build new products to improve those efficiency gains and to positively impact the environment in other ways.  Our clients are pushing us to deliver more functionality to them faster and faster, and in the meantime, they keep giving us more and more data to learn from and use.  If we took a short-term approach to our jobs as engineers, the platform we are building would collapse in on itself, and that would do no one any good.</p>

<p>Wil Shipley, of Delicious Monster fame, wrote an <a href="http://blog.wilshipley.com/2011/04/success-and-farming-vs-mining.html">interesting article</a> recently, drawing an analogy comparing building software companies to either farming or mining.  When you mine, you take out a loan, purchase a ton of equipment, hire people to dig, strike gold, and profit.  When the gold runs out, you retire.  On the other hand, when you farm, you take out a loan, purchase some equipment and seed, and then you plant and tend.  If things go well, you reap some reward during the harvest season, after which you repeat the cycle, reinvesting your money back into your land.  If you are an adept farmer, you may figure out how to rotate crops and make the most of your land all year long, thus increasing profits.  In his analogy, farming is a long-term approach to building a company, and mining is what you do with a social network for dogs &ndash; build it to flip it.</p>

<p>At OPOWER, this analogy is particularly apropos, because of our first bottom line.  What is more sustainable &ndash; farming or mining?  Clearly, OPOWER is a farming company, and the engineering team is working to ensure the harvest comes in season after season.</p>

    <p>The <a href="http://www.meetup.com/D-CAST/">DC Agile Software Testing MeetUp group</a> met for the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/D-CAST/events/16781293/">first time</a> yesterday. Thanks to everyone that attended for contributing to a very positive experience.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re looking for &ldquo;Better Ways To Make Better Software&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Agile software development is a great way to make good software that satisfies real needs and creates real value to those who build and use that software. Everyone on the team is concerned with the quality of the product. However, sometimes it can be an overwhelming task being the team member whose job it is to insure that the quality of the product is sufficient.</p>

<p>DCAST was created to develop a community of those interested in agile software testing who are also interested in testing agile products more effectively and more efficiently. By sharing our hard won knowledge we can all help make each other&rsquo;s lives easier and more productive.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in sharing how you have raised the quality bar of your agile processes, we would love it if you were a part of this community. If you&rsquo;re interested in learning (or want to all learn together), you&rsquo;re even more welcome.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re going to be <a href="http://www.meetup.com/D-CAST/events/17021962/">meeting again in about a month</a>. Come check out the group if you&rsquo;re in the DC area.</p>

    <p>The Discovery Channel spends an entire week every year convincing us how incredibly awesome sharks are.  How do they do it?  Do they take a mako shark out of the ocean, squeeze it into a suit, and ask it questions about being a shark?  Not hardly.  They let us watch the thing cruising through the open ocean, chasing tuna and scaring the hell out of everyone.</p>

<p>When you apply to OPOWER, we want to see how awesome YOU are in your natural habitat.  Our homework helps us do that &ndash; by giving you a project that you can complete on your own schedule, in your own environment.  Maybe you&rsquo;re a &ldquo;early-morning coffee and Eclipse&rdquo; person, or an &ldquo;up-all-night with pizza and vim&rdquo; type.  Whatever it is, we want to see THAT.</p>

<p>Yes, we also have a more conventional part of our interview process.  You&rsquo;ll talk to us on the phone and in person.  We&rsquo;ll ask you about your current projects, make you answer some tough technical questions, and write code together on a whiteboard.  But the homework is our way of asking you to show us what you&rsquo;re like, on your own terms.</p>

<p>We take our homework pretty seriously, and hope you do, too.  Think carefully about the problems.  Explain what you did (and what you didn&rsquo;t do) using comments and READMEs.  And give us your best code &ndash; polish counts more than features.  Code that&rsquo;s lean, appropriately commented, and thoroughly tested is going to earn high marks, guaranteed.</p>

<p>Our application process is hard.  We know, because every single person in OPOWER&rsquo;s engineering group has been through it.  We do it this way because we want a team full of great people that can produce reliable, real-world solutions.  It may be more work for everybody up front, but we think it&rsquo;s produced great results.  And we think you&rsquo;ll agree when you join us.</p>

    <h2><a href="/2011/01/03/how-to-get-hired-polish">How to Get Hired: Polish</a></h2>
    <p class="meta pull-right">Written on January 03, 2011 by <a href="/authors/dave-copeland">Dave Copeland</a>

    <div class="post-content">
    <p>It&rsquo;s been several months, but we are still <a href="http://www.opowerjobs.com">hiring like crazy</a>, with no chance of stopping.  We get a ton of résumés, and there are many internal hoops a candidate&rsquo;s application package must jump through before we bring someone in for an interview.  Our goal is for anyone who&rsquo;s brought in for an in-person interview to have a very high likelihood of being extended an offer.  To that end, everything is reviewed by OPOWER developers directly.  Résumés go through an initial screening with our recruiters, but everything else goes straight to us, and we look at everything closely and carefully.</p>

<p>One thing I&rsquo;ve noticed about successful candidates is <em>polish</em>.  This isn&rsquo;t a word thrown around when discussing developers a whole lot, but I&rsquo;ve found it to be a strong indicator of a true software professional.  The OPOWER application is more than just a résumé; it&rsquo;s a written quiz and a coding assignment as well. Sloppiness at any point is a negative; it shows that the candidate just doesn&rsquo;t give a shit about getting the job.  It&rsquo;s not a deal-breaker, but it has a huge effect on how excited we get about a candidate, <strong>and</strong> it could be the deciding factor between two otherwise identical candidates.  It&rsquo;s our version of <a href="http://gettingreal.37signals.com/ch08_Wordsmiths.php">&ldquo;hire the better writer.&rdquo;</a></p>

<p>So, what do I mean by &ldquo;polish&rdquo;?  Here&rsquo;s a few examples:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Make your code <em>better</em> than you would &ldquo;at work.&rdquo;  Don&rsquo;t make me download the JUnit jar and type <code>javac `find . -name "*.java"`</code> to compile your code; give me a <code>pom.xml</code> or Ant file with Ivy support.</li>
  <li>Send PDFs instead of MS-Word; they are so much easier on the eyes (and processor).  This is dead simple on OS X, <a href="http://www.cutepdf.com/products/cutepdf/writer.asp">there&rsquo;s some free options for Windows</a>, and there&rsquo;s always <a href="http://www.latex-project.org/">LaTeX</a> (which will definitely earn you some geek cred :)</li>
  <li>Don&rsquo;t send me the functional spec of your last project and call it a résumé.  Use bullet lists, short sentences, and formatting to create an easy-to-scan CV.</li>
  <li>Format your writing; compare <a href="/img/sloppy.jpg">this</a>, to <a href="/img/polished.jpg">this</a>.  Even though they both are excerpts from correctly-answered quizzes, which one is going to be easier and more engaging for me to read?</li>
  <li>English: <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110912/quotes">do you speak it?</a>.  Being able to communicate effectively using the written word is absolutely <strong>crucial</strong> for being a good developer, especially at OPOWER.  It doesn&rsquo;t need to be your first, or even best, language; you just need to wield it as effectively as you do Java</li>
</ul>

<p>A lack of polish won&rsquo;t get you refused, but putting an extra shine on your application can make you stand out quite a bit.</p>

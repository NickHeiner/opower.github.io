                <h2>Why Homework?</h2>
<p class="meta">10 Mar 2011</p>

<div class="post">
<p>The Discovery Channel spends an entire week every year convincing us how incredibly awesome sharks are.  How do they do it?  Do they take a mako shark out of the ocean, squeeze it into a suit, and ask it questions about being a shark?  Not hardly.  They let us watch the thing cruising through the open ocean, chasing tuna and scaring the hell out of everyone.</p>

<p>When you apply to OPOWER, we want to see how awesome YOU are in your natural habitat.  Our homework helps us do that -- by giving you a project that you can complete on your own schedule, in your own environment.  Maybe you&#39;re a &quot;early-morning coffee and Eclipse&quot; person, or an &quot;up-all-night with pizza and vim&quot; type.  Whatever it is, we want to see THAT.</p>

<p>Yes, we also have a more conventional part of our interview process.  You&#39;ll talk to us on the phone and in person.  We&#39;ll ask you about your current projects, make you answer some tough technical questions, and write code together on a whiteboard.  But the homework is our way of asking you to show us what you&#39;re like, on your own terms.</p>

<p>We take our homework pretty seriously, and hope you do, too.  Think carefully about the problems.  Explain what you did (and what you didn&#39;t do) using comments and READMEs.  And give us your best code -- polish counts more than features.  Code that&#39;s lean, appropriately commented, and thoroughly tested is going to earn high marks, guaranteed.</p>

<p>Our application process is hard.  We know, because every single person in OPOWER&#39;s engineering group has been through it.  We do it this way because we want a team full of great people that can produce reliable, real-world solutions.  It may be more work for everybody up front, but we think it&#39;s produced great results.  And we think you&#39;ll agree when you join us.</p>

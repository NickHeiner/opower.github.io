<div class="post">
<p>Dave, My OPOWER colleague switched from a normal office desk &amp; chair situation to a standing desk more than a year ago and ever since, I&#39;d been considering doing the same.  For my entire programming career, I&#39;ve had terrible posture in my chair and tended to do &quot;the maxell pose&quot; where my wrists are resting at a severe angle on the lip of my desk.</p>

<p>There have been a couple articles recently about the effects of sitting in a chair all day that pushed me to action.  This <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/10_19/b4177071221162.htm">article from business week</a> was particularly eye opening.</p>

<p>OPOWER is super cool about empowering developers to be more productive/comfortable/happy/etc so getting approval for expensing some generic Ikea furniture was as easy as a head nod.  A couple weekends ago, I drove down to Ikea and picked up an <a href="http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/S49843462">Utby desk</a> for about $100 and an <a href="http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/90167477">Ekby Viktor</a> shelf with <a href="http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/00054564">Capita</a> legs for another $20 or so.  I didn&#39;t think the desk by itself was going to be quite at the recommended elbow height, so I swung by Home Depot and got 4 cinder blocks too.</p>

<p>I ended up putting a stack of paper between my monitor and the shelf to really get it up at eye level and I&#39;m pretty happy with the way it turned out:</p>

<p>Dave&#39;s setup is very similar, but he seems to like focusing <em>down</em> on his single screen whereas I like having a couple monitors at different focus points where I can physically distinguish tasks (documentation, music, images on my laptop off to the side and development tasks on the main monitor straight ahead).</p>

<p>It&#39;s been a couple weeks since I switched and I can draw the following conclusions so far:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Your feet hurt like a sonofabitch at the end of 8, 9, 10 hours if you&#39;re not used to standing that whole time</p></li>
<li><p>A little bar stool or some off-the-floor step helps a lot in shifting your weight around so you&#39;re not always bearing down on both heels</p></li>
<li><p>My back feels a ton better</p></li>
<li><p>I <em>feel</em> more productive (though I don&#39;t know empirically if I actually am) because (a) I feel really focused on the monitor right in front of me -- more so than when sitting down and (b) I&#39;m a little more self-conscious of my screen being visible to everyone walking by, so I suspect I&#39;ve got a higher percentage of work-related stuff on my screen at all times than I did before.</p></li>
</ul>
